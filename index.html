            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Krsitan Tayo is a born-and-raised Filipino graphic designer and illustrator living in Vancouver, Canada. Before moving to Canada, Kristian earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a major in Visual Communication in the University of the Philippines-Diliman College of Fine Arts and graduated cum laude. He worked with various clients in the Philippines through the various agencies and corporations he worked for - namely, Huskee Digital Inc., the Design Center of the Philippines, and Edsa Shangri-La, Manila. He won multiple awards throughout his time and he's still doing well.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kristian earned his Certificate in Graphic Design from the British Columbia in 2025 and went on to work with one of the biggest agencies in Vancouver. He-cofounded a design studio called Trash Panda Design Studios, which aims to uplift small-to-medium enterprises owned by racial minorities and members of the LGBTQ+ community and help them compete with bigger corporations in the same market. He also authored his award-winning graphic novel series, "The Legend of Hyperion", which tells the story of magic, friendship, and what it takes to be a hero. The graphic novel inspired the Emmy-nominated HBO Max fantasy TV series of the same name and had Kristian at the helm as writer and executive producer.</p>
